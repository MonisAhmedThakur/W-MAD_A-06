	<h1>Traditional Art</h1>
	<p><b>It began with muddy handprints slapped on cave walls and progressed to mediums that are still practiced today,
			such as painting, drawing, and sculpture. Traditional arts include any type of creative practice passed down
			through generations.</b> </p>

	<h2>What are the characteristics of traditional art?</h2>
	<p><i> The most distinctive characteristics of "folk art" concern the materials and creative techniques used. Thus,
			unlike in more sophisticated art, "folk art" tended to make use of natural substances like wood, straw, clay
			and so on. Tools tended to be fewer in number but invariably multi-purpose.</i> <br />
