            Nihari is a stew originating in Lucknow, the capital of 18th-century Awadh under the Mughal Empire in the
            Indian subcontinent. <br />
            It consists of slow-cooked meat, mainly a shank cut of beef and its brain. <br />
            It is flavoured with long pepper, a relative of black pepper.
